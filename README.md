# Visualizing UN Population Prospects

The projections of population growth is established by the [UN World Population Division](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/). The dataset has three variations in population projections: low, medium, and high. The medium prospects expect the fertility rates to decrease from 2.5 births per women to 2.0. The high variant assumes that the fertility rates will remain at 2.5 births per women.

This project aims to visualize these projections and answer a few questions:
- What countries will see the most significant population decline?
- What nations will see the most significant population growth?
- Will China still be the most populous country going forward, or will another nation overtake it?

I will use the [ISO Country Codes](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes) to make the analysis easier.
